# Examples

The `.txt` files in this folder show example uses of **bibref**'s commands.
Most of them have been created in an early development stage of the program.
This means that either the underlying databases or the indexing routines
were that time incomplete or erroneous. Therefore, the outputs of the
input commands may be different when using a recent version of the program.

In a future version of **bibref**, these examples will be revisited and
updated to the current state-of-the-art of the program. Please stay tuned.

To check these files quickly, open a terminal and issue `bibref < example.txt`
by using the desired test file name instead of **example.txt**.
