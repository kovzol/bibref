## Some Bible editions and commentaries suggest that Romans 11:35 is an allusion of Job 41:3.
## There is, however, not much evidence on this by checking the Greek texts.
## In fact, by using bibref, we can find the closest text from Job that may be similar to Romans 11:35,
## but the obtained result is still too far, at least contextually not really an evidence, see below.

## Both of these matches (from Job 21:19-20 and 34:19-20) seem to be contextually too far.
## As a conclusion, it seems that Paul does not refer to Job, at least not by quoting a text from Job.
