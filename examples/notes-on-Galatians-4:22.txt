lookup SBLGNT Galatians 4:22
# γεγραπται γαρ οτι Αβρααμ δυο υιους εσχεν, ενα εκ της παιδισκης και ενα εκ της ελευθερας·

## By using Sword's search "παιδισ* ελευθε*" (slave/free) we get two results from Jeremiah 34,
## but they are contextually non-matching.

## Traditionally Galatians 4:22 refers to Genesis 16:15 and 21:2, but no literal evidence
## can be found. In Galatians a longer story is summarized. On the other hand, the
## introductory words "γεγραπται γαρ οτι" are misleading because these words usually
## introduce a literal quotation.

## Conclusion. Presence of usual introductory words of a quotation does not always mean
## that a literal quotation is given (even if the author is Paul!).
