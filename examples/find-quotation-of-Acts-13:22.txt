# και μεταστησας αυτον ηγειρεν ⸂τον Δαυιδ αυτοις⸃ εις βασιλεα, ω και ειπεν μαρτυρησας· Ευρον Δαυιδ τον του Ιεσσαι, ανδρα κατα την καρδιαν μου, ος ποιησει παντα τα θεληματα μου.

# LXX Psalms 88:21+3 88:21-34 = SBLGNT Matthew 1:6+18 1:6-48 (length=10, pos1=103499, pos2=421)
# LXX Psalms 88:21 88:21-34 = SBLGNT Acts 13:22+68 13:22-58 (length=13, pos1=103496, pos2=42852)

## Here the last match is confirmed by scholars, e.g. by Ellicott (https://biblehub.com/commentaries/acts/13-22.htm),
## and I_Samuel 13:14 is also given as the second part of the composite quotation.

lookup LXX I_Samuel 13:14
# και νυν η βασιλεια σου ου στησεται και ζητησει κυριος εαυτω ανθρωπον κατα την καρδιαν αυτου και εντελειται κυριος αυτω εις αρχοντα επι τον λαον αυτου οτι ουκ εφυλαξας οσα ενετειλατο σοι κυριος

## Here the words "ανθρωπον κατα την καρδιαν" are literally quite close to the quoted text in Acts 13:22, but
## not completely the same. In fact, the Sword search gives 10 additional matches, however, contextually I_Samuel 13:14
## seems to be the best fit.

## Further parts of the quoted text in Acts may refer to Isaiah 44:28 that speaks about Cyrus ("παντα τα θεληματα μου ποιησε").

## The quotation in Acts 13:22 seems indeed a combination of quotation, but it is difficult to tell
## exactly which passages are quoted. It seems plausible that Paul starts with Psalm 88:21 and then just
## mentions other parts of life of David's, without exact matches.
