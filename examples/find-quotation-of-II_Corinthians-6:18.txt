lookup SBLGNT II_Corinthians 6:18
# και εσομαι υμιν εις πατερα, και υμεις εσεσθε μοι εις υιους και θυγατερας, λεγει κυριος παντοκρατωρ.

## In Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers (see https://biblehub.com/commentaries/2_corinthians/6-18.htm)
## a mosaic of citations is suggested. According to the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges,
## it is a combination of various passages. The Pulpic Commentary writes:
## "These reminiscences are sufficiently near to 2 Samuel 7:8-14; Isaiah 43:6; Jeremiah 31:9".
## We find that:

lookup LXX II_Samuel 7:14
# εγω εσομαι αυτω εις πατερα και αυτος εσται μοι εις υιον και εαν ελθη η αδικια αυτου και ελεγξω αυτον εν ραβδω ανδρων και εν αφαις υιων ανθρωπων

## But the beginning of this is literally the same as the next passage:

lookup LXX I_Chronicles 17:13
# εγω εσομαι αυτω εις πατερα και αυτος εσται μοι εις υιον και το ελεος μου ουκ αποστησω απ αυτου ως απεστησα απο των οντων εμπροσθεν σου

## Anyway, both texts are just partial matches and far-fuzzy:

## There seems to be several matches on the next part of II_Corinthians (on the topic "sons and daughters"),
## but contextually Isaiah 43:6 seems to be a close enough one:

lookup LXX Isaiah 43:6
# ερω τω βορρα αγε και τω λιβι μη κωλυε αγε τους υιους μου απο γης πορρωθεν και τας θυγατερας μου απ ακρων της γης
lookup KJV Isaiah 43:6
# I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;

## Also, the end of Paul's text ("λεγει κυριος παντοκρατωρ") is present several (!) times in LXX
## not just in II_Samuel 7:8 as it is mentioned in Elliott's.

## Conclusion. II_Corinthians 6:18 seems to be indeed a combination of more passages,
## however, the quoted passages seem to be not unique and not literally matching.
## Maybe the best identification of Paul's method is a sort of "combination of free quotations",
## but the analysis of Paul's passage seems to be extremely difficult and unsure.

## Note. The second quotation in Hebrews 1:5 matches to both II_Samuel 7:14 and I_Chronicles 7:13:

lookup SBLGNT Hebrews 1:5
# Τινι γαρ ειπεν ποτε των αγγελων· Υιος μου ει συ, εγω σημερον γεγεννηκα σε, και παλιν· Εγω εσομαι αυτω εις πατερα, και αυτος εσται μοι εις υιον;
lookup LXX II_Samuel 7:14
# εγω εσομαι αυτω εις πατερα και αυτος εσται μοι εις υιον και εαν ελθη η αδικια αυτου και ελεγξω αυτον εν ραβδω ανδρων και εν αφαις υιων ανθρωπων
