## Background: Isaiah 40:3 is quoted in all the four gospels.
## Mostly literally, but John's quotation can be better identified with a fuzzy comparison.

# Comparing 'fvnhbovntosentherhmvetoimasatethnodonkyrioy' ~ 'fvnhbovntosentherhmveyuynatethnodonkyrioy' = 12
# difference = 0.154762
jaccard12
# Jaccard distance is 0.166667.
length1
# Length of text 1 is 43.
length2
# Length of text 2 is 41.

## This is acceptable.
## On the other hand, the word "ευθείας" (straight) follows the quoted text in LXX, and a similar
## word is used by John in the middle of quotation: "Εὐθύνατε" (make straight). As an option,
## we can consider a longer text from LXX (which includes the three additional letters "ευθ")
## and this gives a better match with the compare algorithm, but a worse match with Jaccard:

lookup1 LXX Isaiah 40:3 40:3-32
# Stored internally as fvnhbovntosentherhmvetoimasatethnodonkyrioyeyu.
compare12
# Comparing 'fvnhbovntosentherhmvetoimasatethnodonkyrioyeyu' ~ 'fvnhbovntosentherhmveyuynatethnodonkyrioy' = 11
# difference = 0.137931
jaccard12
# Jaccard distance is 0.177778.

## This is still acceptable, however, this influences the detection of possible extension.
## At the moment, the database for the "manual" entry of this match above considers
## the Jaccard distance and points to the shorter match.
