## In this study we check the various quotations present in John 19.

## 1. John 19:24
## ινα η γραφη πληρωθη η λεγουσα = that the Scripture might be fulfilled that said
## This is a clear literal quotation from Psalms 22:18.

## 2. John 19:28
## ινα τελειωθη η γραφη λεγει = so that might be fulfilled the Scripture He says
## Here there is only one word "quoted", and seemingly it is not a literal quotation.

## 3. John 19:36
## ινα η γραφη πληρωθη = so that the Scripture might be fulfilled
## This is a clear quotation from Exodus 12:10.

## 4. John 19:37
## και παλιν ετερα γραφη λεγει = and again another Scripture says
## Here the word εξεκεντησαν (they have pierced) can be found only once in LXX,
## namely in Joshua 16:10, in a different context. It is difficult to
## find any literal matches. Contextually Zechariah 12:10 is close, but literally not.

## In all four passages the Scripture is mentioned, but only two refer to literal matches.
