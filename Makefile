# Obsoleted information on building the web version of bibref:

# Steps to perform:
#
# 0. Install all prerequisites of the native version, and build it properly (via cmake).
#    You can choose an arbitrary folder, this Makefile will find it later, assuming
#    that there is only one folder which fits (see the BIBREF_NATIVE_BUILD variable below).
#    You need to run "make install" as well to have a minimally working local SWORD
#    installation. (This step may finally fail because of missing write privileges to
#    /usr, but that's okay.) If you already have a ~/.sword folder with other modules
#    than supported by bibref by default, then you should skip the step "make install".
#
# 1. Install Emscripten and enable that its utilities are available on your path.
#    It is usually safe to install and activate the latest stable version.
#
# 2. Build libsword.a by using https://github.com/kovzol/crosswire-sword-mirror
#    and the cmake toolchain from Emscripten (via
#    "emcmake cmake -DSWORD_BUILD_UTILS=No -DSWORD_BUILD_EXAMPLES=No -DLIBSWORD_LIBRARY_TYPE=Static ..").
#    You may need to have a recent cmake. Then run "make sword_static" to
#    build libsword.a and type "make install" to copy the library automatically
#    to the folders .../emsdk/cache/sysroot/{lib,share,include}. The settings
#    in the cmake configuration are important, otherwise the SWORD utilities
#    and examples will also be built, but some of them will eventually fail
#    and the library will not be copied to the official emsdk folder.
#    (In that case you need to do that manually.) There can be no shared library created
#    on this platform, only static, but that's okay.
#
# 3. Step 2 will make sure that libsword.a is visible for the rest of the process.
#    Unfortunately, since static libraries are not available published properly by
#    the SWORD library setup, we still have to work around manually that
#    the first LDFLAGS setting extends the scope to find the library also under the ".." folder.
#
# 4. Create symlinks in this folder to the files statements/{pbrst.c,pbrst.tab.c,pbrst.tab.h}.
#    These files will be present only if you successfully compile the native program above.
#    Issue then "emmake make wasm" in the current directory.
#
# See also the GitHub actions in the .github/ folder for more information on the
# steps above. They may be somewhat different, but hopefully still working.
#
# 5. Copy the files wasm-build/bibref.html and wasm-build/bibref.data to a web server.
#    Note that bibref.data contains the whole content of your ~/.sword folder.
#    (In case you want to add/remove Bible texts, use Sword's command line
#    "installmgr" to fine tune the contents of the ~/.sword folder. See
#    the end of CMakeLists.txt for some examples.)
#
# 6. Open wasm-build/bibref.html in your browser. Open Developer Tools (F12 in most browsers).
#
# 7. Go to the JavaScript Console and type:
#
#    bibref = Module.cwrap("bibref_wasm", "string", ["string"])
#
#    If you get an answer like "Æ’ (){return ccall(A,g,B,arguments,C)}" then bibref
#    should be properly installed.
#
# 8. Now you can use any bibref commands in the JavaScript Console like this:
#
#    bibref("help")
#    bibref("lookup LXX Genesis 1:1")
#    bibref("addbooks")
#
#    The web platform is somewhat slower than the native version, but fully functional.
#
# 9. In case you want to create an embedded version of bibref in an HTML page, you may
#    want to use the template in the html/ folder. You need to create a JavaScript
#    version of the web build of bibref by using "TARGET_HTML=bibref.js emmake make wasm".
#    Then simply copy the files wasm-build/bibref.html and wasm-build/bibref.data
#    to the html/ folder, and finally the whole folder to a web server.
